About me üêè
------

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in [System Engineering and Engineering Managemant (SEEM)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/), Hong Kong SAR, supervised by [Prof. Wai Lam](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-lam-wai/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html) in June 2025. During my undergraduate studies, it was my great honor to receive the guidance from [Prof. Jianghong Ma](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/majianghong), [Prof. Shanshan Feng](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/fengshanshan12/zh_CN/) at HITsz, and [Prof. Sibo Wang](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~swang/) at CUHK. I also worked as a research intern at Tencent Weixin Group (WXG), Shenzhen from Sep. 2024 to Jun. 2025, where I was luckily guided by [Yuanhao Feng](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Yuanhao_Feng2), [Dr. Guilin Li](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Guilin_Li2), and [Bo Wang](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Bo_Wang50). 



Research areas ü§î

Currently, I am working on research related to Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), including:
- Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought
- Hallucination of MLLMs

Besides, my focus was on data mining, including:
- Graph Neural Networks
- Graph Anomaly Detection
- Recommender Systems
